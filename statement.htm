		  world is a labyrinth of images. They surround, inspire and influence
		  us, teach or reflect our inner selves. Sometimes they replace our
		  words. Since early childhood I have been profoundly impressed by works
		  of art. I would have preferred to stare endlessly into a painting
		  or photograph rather than talk to people. I remember myself trying
		  to comprehend the image, or to travel inside it with my mind, capturing
		  its atmosphere and meanings. I also remember watching my father painting
		  and trying to imagine what he was thinking as he unveiled his images
		  on the canvas. These mental trips provided me with a sensitive, insightful
		  view of the surrounding world and a continuous source of joy and satisfaction.
		  In a way, the subjective world became closer to me and more important
		  than the external one. I use art as a tool that helps me understand
		  and display my own emotional and spiritual life. I am seeking an essentially
		  classical path combined with an intensely personal vision. My paintings
		  are executed using acrylic and oils on various substrates (canvas,
		  paper and wood panels) and some combined mixed media. The subject
		  matter of my works are related to nature, the artistic expression
		  of the human spirit and sociopolitical issues. I have tried to further
		  develop the images created in my paintings using other media, consequently
		  I have approached printmaking, computer imaging and ceramic. I have
		  blended my aesthetic sensibility and perceptions with learned concepts
		  and techniques. I have tried to remain faithful to my European heritage,
		  artistically more conservative, but I have also felt the need to explore
		  the new trends discovered in the American artistic milieu. I have
		  always passionately loved art and pursued the artistic phenomenon
		  with genuine interest in every country I lived or visited. I bear
		  many influences and have been impressed by many artists and their
		  work, but I have tried to learn to express myself in an original way.
		  I find Robert Rauschenberg's words very inspiring when referring to
		  the art making process: &quot;Painting relates to both art and life.
		  Neither can be made.&quot; My works do reflect the present stage of
		  my artistic development as a synthesis of my past and a beginning
		  of my future artistic expression.</font></div>
